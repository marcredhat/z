----
We'll show how to deploy an 
emulated Z mainframe (zD&T EE) and 
OpenShift 4.4.5 UPI 
on one baremetal server (RHEL 7 / KVM / libvirt)
----

----
We'll also show how to build, deploy and run applications on the emulated mainframe 
using Visual Studio Code, the Zowe extension and the Zowe CLI.
(You can of course also connect to the emulated mainframe using x3270)
